You'll investigate the lava tubes on Isla San Martin; climb El Trono Blanco, Baja's magnificent 1,600-foot big wall; hike to Tinaja de Yubay; backpack in the Sierra de la Laguna and to Arroyo Grande; and explore, fish, and dive the Midriff region, the \"Mexican Galapagos.\" You'll discover the wrecks of the great sailing ship John Elliott Thayer, the paddlewheel steamer Golden City, and the US submarine H-I -- almost-forgotten incidents in Baja's history. Exact locations are provided for Marisla Seamount, the most famous scuba diving location in the Sea of Cortez, and to many other lesser-known locations like Ben's Rock and the Islas de San Benito.

It's not on any chart, but the tropical island of Cayo Loco is the perfect place to run away from all your problems. Waking from a ganja buzz on the beach in Tulum, Tully can't believe his eyes when a 142-foot schooner emerges out of the ocean mist. At its helm is Cleopatra Highbourne, the eccentric 101-year-old sea captain who will take him to a lighthouse on a salty piece of land that will change his life forever. From a lovely sunset sail in Punta Margarita to a wild spring-break foam party in San Pedro, Tully encounters an assortment of treasure hunters, rock stars, sailors, seaplane pilots, pirates, and even a ghost or two. \"A tangy tale...Fresh, fanciful, finely imagined...Very possible Buffett's best work to date.\" --New York Times Book Review",

Kids and adults agree, these are the books that get 9- to 12-year-olds reading. YOU are on vacation in Connecticut when you notice a huge, empty stone house at the top of a hill. Your cousins call it \"Chimney Rock,\" and they tell you that no one who goes inside is ever seen again, but you're the curious type, and so you venture inside its crumbling walls. Will you break the curse on Chimney Rock and come back out again a hero? Or will you face any number of grisly ends at the hands of the malevolent forces within? Be careful, the choices YOU make might end in glory, disaster, or certain death! A generation of readers was enraptured by the early classics of Choose Your Own Adventure, and while long-time fans will be thrilled to see its return to the shelves, new kid readers will love to explore one path after another, with every ending telling them a little more about the mystery of what happened at Chimney Rock and what can be done to break the curse.",

        "description": "This handbook presents the latest research, industry trends, developments and initiatives in adventure tourism. It explores conceptualisations of adventure tourism, historical and intellectual developments, insights into adventure tourists and the supply side of adventure tourism, and sustainable and inclusive adventure tourism. With contributions from leading international researchers, 28 chapters are organised into four thematic parts to provide a comprehensive overview of adventure tourism. The book presents core topics within the field as well as contemporary themes, debates and challenges within the industry. It adopts a multidisciplinary approach which draws on and applies current research from disciplines including tourism, recreation, sport and psychology to adventure tourism. As such, it presents different ways of examining this form of tourism, expands knowledge on recent developments and discusses the major claims in this field. It explores topics such as instantly accessible adventures, the increasing use of technology by adventure tourists and industry, and the well-being of tourists, destinations and communities. The handbook informs the reader of how literature translates into practice across different adventure tourism operations. It also investigates some of the key challenges affecting the adventure tourism industry and presents practical solutions and initiatives to overcome these. Case studies and vignettes are embedded throughout the handbook to illustrate practitioner perspectives, and each chapter includes learning outcomes and review questions to encourage readers to further consolidate their understanding. The handbook is intended for undergraduates, postgraduates, doctoral candidates and early-career and more established researchers interested in the fields of adventure tourism and related disciplines, such as adventure recreation, outdoor leadership and outdoor education. It is useful for industry organisations, policymakers, professionals and those working towards outdoor activity qualifications. It is also a valuable resource for supportingrelated modules on sustainable tourism, consumer behaviour and marketing in tourism.",
