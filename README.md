# Data Modeling with MySQL

## Overview

In this project, I apply data modeling concepts to gather and store data in a MySQL database. The analytics team of a
publishing company is hoping to find insights on marketing strategies for books with selected keywords in the title.
Data will be collected using the Google Books API, validated using Pydantic and relevant fields will be stored in
a MySQL database for further analysis by the analytics team.
